                <p>Our journey began with a formidable challenge presented to us: Tracking, Reducing, 
                    and Reusing Plastic Waste. The problem statement, PSID: SG864, was a pressing issue 
                    that resonated deeply with us. As a team, we knew that addressing the growing plastic 
                    waste crisis required innovative solutions, 
                    and we were determined to make a meaningful impact.

                            Despite our differences in backgrounds and expertise, we shared a common goal: to create something
                            remarkable. The synergy within our team was palpable from the very beginning. The collaboration,

                    <p class="text-justify">
                        The 36-hour coding marathon was both grueling and exhilarating. 
                        As the clock ticked away, we immersed ourselves in developing a solution 
                        that could effectively track, reduce, and promote the reuse of plastic waste.
                         The intensity of the hackathon pushed us to our limits, but it also brought 
                         out the best in us. Each team member played a crucial role, contributing their
                          expertise to build a solution that was not only technically sound but also 
                          socially impactful..

                        refining our user interface, every obstacle tested our perseverance. However, what stood out the 
                        most was the unwavering support and cooperation within our team. Whenever one of us hit a roadblock,
                         the others were there to offer guidance and encouragement. This spirit of 
                         camaraderie was the backbone of our success.
