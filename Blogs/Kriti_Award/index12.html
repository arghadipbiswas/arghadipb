                <p>
                    One of the most unforgettable moments of this journey was the special recognition given by our principal. 
                    Following our victory at the Smart India Hackathon, our principal extended a heartfelt invitation to us and
                    our parents to formally receive the award at a special ceremony. This event was more than just a formality; 
                    it was a celebration of our hard work, dedication, and the unwavering support from our families.

                            pride and accomplishment. After the ceremony, we were treated to a delightful lunch, where 
                            we shared stories, laughter, and the joy of our achievement. This gesture by our principal made
                            the moment truly historic, etching it into my memory as one of the most significant days of 
                            my life.

                        Standing beside my parents while receiving the Kriti Award from our principal was an emotionally overwhelming 
                        experience. This was not just my achievement; it was a moment that symbolized the sacrifices, encouragement, 
                        and unwavering support of my parents throughout my journey. 
                        As I looked into their eyes, filled with pride and joy, I felt an indescribable sense of fulfillment.

                        borne fruit—not just for me, but for my parents as well. Seeing them so proud made me feel like 
                        I had finally given something back to them, a tangible proof that their belief in me was justified. 
                        This recognition was not just an award; 
                        it was a validation of the efforts that we, as a family, had collectively invested in my future.
